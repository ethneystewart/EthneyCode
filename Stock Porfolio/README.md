## Descriptions:
The purpose of this exercise was to learn more about calling API's, manipulating the data, and stocks. 
Created a web interface using the package, flask. 
Although I have a Key from the API website I used to pull stocks it wont allow more than 20 calls a day so have been building using the demo key and using the one demo stock, IBM. However it is set up to take in more than one stock. 

# Setup Details:
Required packages: flask, pandas, plotly.
