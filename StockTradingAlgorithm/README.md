# Stock Trading Algorithm 
The code inlcuded in this folder is apart of one project that I assisted in coding that focused on finding a correlation between stocks. Through the process of helping with this project I did lots of data analysis and comparison between different variations of the model. 
However, in the end it was found that this algorithm did not work as the percent win when simulated ended up resulting in around 50% (you might as well flip a coin).

Some of the main function I helped code on this project are:

Scanner.py: pctwintot_calc, profit_total_calc, get_dayprofit_array
  
Indicators.py: FindCorrelations
  
AutoScanner.py: SimulateCalcTrades, SimulateTrades
  
Webpage Additions (HTML): 
 
AIDEEP: created a collapse button,  created total row, changed colours of text 

AICORR: created drop down menu, changed colours of text
  

Pictures of webpages can be found in repository.
