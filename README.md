# EthneyCode
The Code inlcuded in this repository are all apart of one project that focused on finding a correlation between stocks. Through the process of helping with this project I did lots of data analysis and comparison between different variations of the model. 
However, in the end it was found that this algorithm did not work as the percent win when simulated ended up resulting in around 50% (you might as well flip a coin).

Some of the main function I helped code on this project are:

Scanner.py: 
  pctwintot_calc
  profit_total_calc
