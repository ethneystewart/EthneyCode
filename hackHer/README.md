This was the first hackathon I have ever entered, my team and I won our category, Food Insecurity with our solution. 

Our project Graze is a website that combats the inflation in food prices and the increased cost of living by giving users the ability to find the best prices for groceries. Graze is user-driven allowing people to input their own price discoveries and is aimed to create competition between grocery stores to lower inflation.
